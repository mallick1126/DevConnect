# Registration Form using MERN Stack

This project implements a registration form application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to register by providing their personal information and storing it securely in a MongoDB database.

## Features

- User-friendly registration form with input validation.
- Secure storage of user information in a MongoDB database.
- Client-side form validation to ensure data integrity.
- Responsive user interface design for optimal viewing on different devices.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user information.
- Express.js: A web application framework for building the server-side API.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework for responsive web design.
- HTML5 and CSS3: Markup and styling languages for structuring and designing the application.
